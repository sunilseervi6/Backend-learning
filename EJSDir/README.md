# ðŸŽ¯ EJS & Express.js Learning Notes

This document captures my learnings while exploring **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)** with **Express.js** for server-side rendering in Node.js applications.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What is EJS?

**EJS** is a simple templating engine that allows you to embed JavaScript directly into your HTML using `<%= %>` syntax. It helps build dynamic HTML pages by combining logic with view templates.

---

## ðŸ§  Why Use EJS?

- âœ… To insert dynamic values into HTML
- âœ… To run logic like loops and conditions in templates
- âœ… To keep code clean with reusable layouts (partials)
- âœ… To separate server logic from presentation
- âœ… To avoid messy HTML string-building in JavaScript

---

npm init -y
npm install express ejs


## 1. Why do we use app.set("views", path.join(...))?

By default, Express looks for views in a views/ folder relative to where the server runs. This line ensures that Express always correctly finds the views folder even if you run the server from a different location (like parent folder).

Without it? You might get an error if Express can't find the EJS files.

## ðŸ§ª EJS Interpolation Syntax

| Syntax           | Purpose                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
| `<%= value %>`   | Output escaped value           |
| `<%- value %>`   | Output unescaped/raw HTML      |
| `<% code %>`     | Execute JS logic (no output)   |
| `<%# comment %>` | Add EJS-only comment           |

### ðŸ”¹ Examples:
```ejs
<h3><%= 1 + 2 %></h3>                     <!-- Outputs: 3 -->
<h3><%= ["hello", "bonjour"][1] %></h3>  <!-- Outputs: bonjour -->
<h3><%= "sunil".toUpperCase() %></h3>    <!-- Outputs: SUNIL -->


```
## conditional statemenst in EJS
<% %> -- for control flow , no outputs
have used this in rollDice.ejs

## loops in EJS
have used this in instagram.ejs

## Serving static files
these are the assests that do not chnange dynamicaly for each user or request
syntax --- app.use(express.static(foldername))

to access them in html or ejs files
have given style and ejs using static files in instagram.ejs file , index.js

## include
It is used in EJS templates to include another EJS file inside the current template
have used in instagram.ejs ....where i have included the head section and footer section
